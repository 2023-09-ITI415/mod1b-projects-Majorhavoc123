The goal of this project is to combine aspects from both "Roll a Ball" and "Mission Demolition" to create the game "Mouse Maze". The 
framework I am using to base my game off of is the MDA framework. I am creating the mechanic (being a mouse) and hoping to envoke some
feeling of curiosity in my player (Where can I go next? Where haven't I gone already?). Hopefully, what I am able to create will 
accomplish this task and also, have it be an enjoyable experience overall.
