The goal of this project is to combine aspects from both "Roll a Ball" and "Mission Demolition" to create the game "Mouse Maze". The 
framework I am using to base my game off of is the MDA framework. I am creating the mechanic (being a mouse) and hoping to envoke some
feeling of curiosity in my player (Where can I go next? Where haven't I gone already?). Hopefully, what I am able to create will 
accomplish this task and also, it be an enjoyable experience overall.

Story:

You are one of four mice that has taken up refuge in a suburban home. Winter has been hard and you have had to scrounge up food whenever
you can. You have to search the house to hopefully find enough cheese that will hold you and your friends over for a little while longer. 

Good Luck!
